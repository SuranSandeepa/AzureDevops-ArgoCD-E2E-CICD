# AzureDevops-ArgoCD-E2E-CICD


This project demonstrates the integration of Azure DevOps Continuous Integration (CI) and ArgoCD for continuous deployment (CD) in a Kubernetes environment. It showcases the automation of building Docker images, pushing them to Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster using ArgoCD for GitOps-style deployments. The CI pipeline builds and pushes the Docker image, while ArgoCD ensures seamless, automated synchronization between Git repositories and the Kubernetes environment. This project highlights the power of DevOps tools in automating workflows and streamlining the deployment process for cloud-native applications.
